# blossom

A lovely interactive music generator.



## Inspiration

This was inspired by the apps [Bloom](http://generativemusic.com/bloom.html) and [Bloom: 10 Worlds](http://generativemusic.com/bloom10worlds.html) by Peter Chilvers and Brian Eno, which are both fantastic and much better than this. I wanted to see if I could create a similar experience in the browser.

## Installation

You will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine.

1. Clone to your machine.
2. Navigate to the project's directory.
3. Run `npm i`.
4. Run `npm start`.
5. Navigate to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
